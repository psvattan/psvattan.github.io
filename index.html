The common thread that connects them all is my desire to improve people’s lives and businesses in an efficient and meaningful way. I’ve founded and developed several notable projects, including Remotely and Founderly, that help entrepreneurs thrive, and I’ve built and sold numerous businesses for profit, including Bloom, a personal CRM that automates the cumbersome process of managing contacts with a personal touch, and Builder, a tool to make landing pages on the fly based on a targeted segment.</article></div></section><article class=pt><div class=container><div class=w-75><h3>Skills That<br>Push Boundaries</h3></div><p class=pl-sm>My diverse stack of skills has helped me continue to push boundaries in the tech world and create bigger and better products. These include (but are definitely not limited to) growth hacking, startup strategy, and full-stack product management.<p class=pl-sm>This eclectic mix of skills and interests led me to build Founderly, a platform that supports tech employees while they become entrepreneurs alongside their day jobs. The brand has received a lot of buzz and interest, and I successfully negotiated and secured partnership offerings with bigger brands and conferences in the first six months of operating.<p class=pl-sm>Like many of the tech talent I work with, I’m also a huge side hustler and I want to help others build their first side hustle or learn the process.</div></article><section class="pt skills"><div class=container><div class=w-75><h4>Get in touch<br>if you need a:</h4></div><div class=grid><div class="pl-sm skill"><div class=line></div><h5>Growth Extraordinaire</h5><p>I believe in steady organic growth and pride myself on taking companies from a seed to successful using tried-and-tested tactics.</div><div class="pl-sm skill"><div class=line></div><h5>Startup Strategist</h5><p>I work with startups to create success strategies that help them stand out with attention-grabbing branding, talented teams, investment, partnerships and, of course, organic growth.

Each year, I attend around 20 conferences to absorb new techniques and meet inspiring people. This ties in with my passion for travel. I’ve been to more than 25 countries and relish spending time exploring new cultures and their local food.<p class=pl-sm>I’m also a keen fashion enthusiast and self-diagnosed tech geek, and I love nothing more than connecting with fellow fashionistas, designers, and influencers. The tech geek part of me is obsessed with automation for micro-tasks - seriously, I have more than 20 bots running 24/7 to help me with business operations, contact marketing, managing my side businesses, sending newsletters, and more. This really is the future!</div></div></article><footer class="pt pb"><div class=container><blockquote><p>I am a growth extraordinaire at heart and, along with my highly creative mind, make an impact on any project I am part of.</blockquote><a href=https://calendly.com/vattan/15min rel=nofollow target=_blank class=button>Let's talk</a></div></footer>
