    <h3>Self-Taught, Self-Made – Story of a Product Architect</h3>
    <p>Self-taught, I have always taken charge of my own education, seeing it as my own personal responsibility. Since then, I have been on a path of constant growth, picking up knowledge and experience in a variety of ways. I started working when I was 16 years old, and since then, I have gone into advertising, marketing, technology, programming, and business growth.</p>
    <p>A product architect and start-up guru, I am passionate about creating new products that solve existing problems. I see improving people’s lives as my highest calling on Earth. If I can make someone’s morning easier, someone’s day more enjoyable, or someone’s evening run more smoothly, I am satisfied. I have developed a few attention-grabbing projects such as <a href="https://remotely.ee" target="_blank">Remotely</a> and <a href="https://founder.ee" target="_blank">Founder.ee</a>, both of which I founded personally.</p>
    <p>My skills include growth hacking, full-stack development, cyber security consulting, and fashion. I am a business development extraordinaire, talented in a number of different areas, and with my creative mind, I make an impact on any project in which I take part.</p>
